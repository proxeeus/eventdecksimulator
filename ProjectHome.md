# Event Deck #

Event Deck Simulator 1.0 is a tool for streamlining advanced games of Warhammer Quest. This application attempts to replicate the standard event deck in the Warhammer Quest game in terms of visual appeal and ease of use, while being as expandable as the system of tables found in the Roleplay book. The intention is to minimize wasted time spent hunting through the Roleplay book for tables and stats once the game has progressed past the first level.

## Features ##

  * XML Based Data - For easy customization and creation of new monsters, events, and tables.
  * Fancy Graphics - A real attempt was made to visually copy the original event deck cards.
  * Cross Platform - Written in Java, Event Deck will run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
  * Integrated Rules - Key-worded special rules are hyperlinked to a data set of rules text so you don't have to flip through the roleplay book looking up special rules.
  * More Complete Data Sets - The initial data included with the game includes both the original basic game deck, plus full event and monster tables from the roleplay book all the way up to level 10.
